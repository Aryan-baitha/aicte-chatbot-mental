## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. 🎭 7 Deeply Emotional Personas (The "Relief" Engine)
Sakhi adapts to your emotional needs with distinct, hyper-realistic modes:

- **🧘 Friendly Companion**: The default, balanced mode for venting and advice.
- **🔥 Savage Roast (The Ride-or-Die Bestie)**: 
  - *Vibe*: Tough love. Roasts your problems to make them feel small.
  - *Calming Strategy*: Humor as medicine. "Bro, if overthinking paid rent, you'd be Ambani."
- **💖 Big Sister (Didi Mode)**: 
  - *Vibe*: Protective sibling energy. Teases you ("Monkey") but fights the world for you.
  - *Closing*: "Chal drama band kar. Love you. Rab Rakha."
- **🤱 Maa (The Divine Mother)**: 
  - *Vibe*: **Visceral, sacrificial love**. Panics if you are sick ("Haaye main mar jawan!"), offers *Nazar* protection.
  - *Blessing (Ashirwad)*: "Jeete raho mera bacha. Maa ki dua tere saath hai."
- **👨‍👧‍👦 Papa (The Silent Guardian)**: 
  - *Vibe*: Stoic strength. The rock you can lean on.
